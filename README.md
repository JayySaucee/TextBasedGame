# TextBasedGame
This is where I will commit the updates to a small text based game programmed in C++. The purpose of this small scale project is to restablish my skills using C++ as
it has been over a year since using the programming langauge. This is primarily due to my computer science courses making use of other languages like javascript,
assembly, etc. So in creating this small mini game project I can get familar with the structure of C++ structure and syntax again. It also provides me with good practice
creating a small text based game that does not require the usage of graphics.

For now the game is incredibly simple making use of two objects, one being a player, while the other is an enemy. Your goal is to defeat your enemy. It is a turn
based game and you have two options, either attack or heal, both of which affect your health or the enemy health in varying amounts, so it'll come down to a gamble on
whether to attack or heal.
